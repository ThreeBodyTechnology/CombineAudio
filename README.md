AudioFileLineUp
===============

Merge a number of wav audio files into a big audio file, and then make entire file back into multiple audio files, if you have 100 drum tracks but only one neve 1073 , you will need this.

This project uses JUCE library:

Now I'm making the console version, I will add GUI interface in the future.
