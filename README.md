AudioFileLineUp
===============

Merge a number of wav audio files into a big audio file, and then make entire file back into multiple audio files, if you have 100 drum tracks but only one neve 1073 , you will need this.

This project uses JUCE library:
https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE

Now I'm making the console version, I will add GUI interface in the future.

Currently supported features: make a whole directory of audio files into a big audio file + an XML file.


Yes I know you need this big audio file back to files, but I haven't finish this function yet.
